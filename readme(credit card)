# Credit_Card_Default_Prediction
Project Title - Credit Card Default Prediction

Technologies - Machine Learning

Domain - Banking

Problem Statement:

Financial threats are displaying a trend about the credit risk of commercial banks as the
incredible improvement in the financial industry has arisen. In this way, one of the
The biggest threats faced by commercial banks is the risk prediction of credit clients.
The goal is to predict the probability of credit default based on credit card owner's
characteristics and payment history.

Approach:

The classical machine learning tasks like Data Exploration, Data Cleaning,
Feature Engineering, Model Building and Model Testing. Try out different machine
learning algorithms that’s best fit for the above case.

About Dataset:

Dataset Information:

This dataset contains information on default payments, demographic factors, credit
data, history of payment, and bill statements of credit card clients in Taiwan from April
2005 to September 2005.

Content:

There is 25 Variable:
● ID: ID of each client
● LIMIT_BAL: Amount of given credit in NT dollars (includes individual and
family/supplementary credit
● SEX: Gender (1=male, 2=female)
● EDUCATION: (1=graduate school, 2=university, 3=high school, 4=others,
5=unknown, 6=unknown)
● MARRIAGE: Marital status (1=married, 2=single, 3=others)
● AGE: Age in years
● PAY_0: Repayment status in September, 2005 (-1=pay duly, 1=payment delay for
one month, 2=payment delay for two months, … 8=payment delay for eight
months, 9=payment delay for nine months and above)
● PAY_2: Repayment status in August, 2005 (scale same as above)
● PAY_3: Repayment status in July, 2005 (scale same as above)
● PAY_4: Repayment status in June, 2005 (scale same as above)
● PAY_5: Repayment status in May, 2005 (scale same as above)
● PAY_6: Repayment status in April, 2005 (scale same as above)
● BILL_AMT1: Amount of bill statement in September, 2005 (NT dollar)
● BILL_AMT2: Amount of bill statement in August, 2005 (NT dollar)
● BILL_AMT3: Amount of bill statement in July, 2005 (NT dollar)
● BILL_AMT4: Amount of bill statement in June, 2005 (NT dollar)
● BILL_AMT5: Amount of bill statement in May, 2005 (NT dollar)
● BILL_AMT6: Amount of bill statement in April, 2005 (NT dollar)
● PAY_AMT1: Amount of previous payment in September, 2005 (NT dollar)
● PAY_AMT2: Amount of previous payment in August, 2005 (NT dollar)
● PAY_AMT3: Amount of previous payment in July, 2005 (NT dollar)
● PAY_AMT4: Amount of previous payment in June, 2005 (NT dollar)
● PAY_AMT5: Amount of previous payment in May, 2005 (NT dollar)
● PAY_AMT6: Amount of previous payment in April, 2005 (NT dollar)
● default.payment.next.month: Default payment (1=yes, 0=no)

Steps Involved:

* Data Cleaning
* Data Preprocessing
* EDA
* Handling Class Imbalance
* Transformation & Splitting of data
* Logistic Regression
* Decision Tree Classifier
* Random Forest Classifier
* Support Vector Machine
* Gradient Boosting
* XG Boosting
* Cross Validation & Hyperparameter Tunning
* Comparison of Model
* Combined ROC Curve
* Feature Importance

Conclusion:

1. From all baseline model, Random Forest classifier shows highest test accuracy and F1 score and AUC.

2. Baseline model of Random Forest and decision tree shows huge difference in train and test accuracy which shows overfitting.

3. After cross validation and hyperparameter tunning, XG Boost shows highest test accuracy score of 87% and AUC is 0.874.

4. Cross validation and hyperparameter tunning certainly reduces chances of overfitting and also increases performance of model.
